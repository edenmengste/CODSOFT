# CODSOFT

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the C++ Programming Internship at CODSOFT! This repository contains the projects I've developed during my internship, showcasing my skills and progress in C++.

### About Me

I'm Eden Mengste, a highly motivated and enthusiastic aspiring C++ developer eager to learn and contribute. This internship at CODSOFT provides a fantastic opportunity to enhance my programming abilities and gain practical experience in software development.

### Projects

I've completed the following projects as part of my internship:

### Task 1: Number Guessing Game

*   **Description:** A simple game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
*   **Link to Code:** [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/edenmengste/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task_1(number_guessing_game).cpp)

### Task 2: Simple Calculator

*   **Description:** A command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-inputted numbers.
*   **Link to Code:** [Simple Calculator]()

### Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

*   **Description:** A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other. The game includes features like checking for wins, draws, and switching players.
*   **Link to Code:** [Tic-tac-toe Game](https://github.com/edenmengste/CODSOFT/blob/main/task_3(tic_tac_toe).cpp)

### Task 4: To-Do List

*   **Description:** A simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, mark as complete, and remove tasks.
*   **Link to Code:** [Link]

### Task 5: Library Management System (In Progress/Optional)

*   **Description:** (If you attempted this task) A system to manage books, borrowers, and transactions in a library. Features include book search, checkout, return, and fine calculation.
*   **Link to Code:** [Link]

## Future Plans

During this internship, I faced several challenges. Overcoming these challenges helped me learn many things. I plan to continue learning and exploring C++ further by [mention your future learning plans, e.g., working on personal projects, contributing to open-source projects, or learning advanced C++ features].


Thank you for this incredible opportunity! I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a C++ developer.
